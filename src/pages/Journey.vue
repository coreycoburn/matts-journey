      Matt was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer on October 3, 2018 and he was given 12-18 months to enjoy his time here on earth.

      Matt thought it was just another bout of Vertigo when he went to the doctor on that day in October, but he was completely taken back when his CT scan showed a large tumor lodged in his brain, which was determined to be a very aggressive and deadly Glioblastoma, Stage 4 (GBM4). He quickly underwent surgery at UCSF and they successfully removed 95% of this cancerous tumor, the most they could and still leave him with some of quality of life. The aftermath of the tumor leaves Matt with limited mobility on his left side and he spent 2 weeks in Rehab learning to walk again. He has been a strong fighter and does so with a strong faith to God and a positive attitude about life. A GMB4 has no cure and the tumor will eventually take his life, so we are thankful for each day we can share with him. Due to his limitations, Matt was placed on permanent disability and is unable to work which resulted in a severe financial hardship to his family.

      Matt grew up in Yountville, where he attended the local schools and at an early age became a part of the Napa Valley community. His first job, along with his 2 brothers, was delivering the local newspaper to the entire Town of Yountville! His strong work ethic, dependability and easy going personality found him moving into jobs at many of our local restaurants, both as a busser and a server. Over the last 14 years, Matt has managed the business Certified Parking Attendants (CPA), where you would find him at any event that offered valet parking. Matt always greeted you with a warm smile as he provided support to the community’s events. Besides his family, Matt’s other passion in life is baseball, where he is doing his best to visit every Major League Baseball stadium while he cheers on his favorite team.
