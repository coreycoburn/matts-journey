      <p class="md:w-3/4">I'm not sure what content you want to put here. I think it is important for people to understand/learn more about the disease if they want to. The link in the top navigation bar can lead them directly to another site and I don't have to create a dedicated page for that if you know a good place to send people to learn more. Or, if you have several resources for people, I can make this page have several links to external websites. What are your thoughts on this page?</p>
