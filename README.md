# Help Matt Appleby

This website was initially made for Matt's Field of Hope Fundraiser on Sunday, February 23, 2020. This event is to help Matt and his family offset some of his medical expenses that are not covered by his insurance and to ease the burden caused by his dramatically reduced income.

The Field of Hope page allows attendees to purchase tickets, people to help donate to Matt and his family, as well as be an event sponsor.

This website will also be the place for people following Matt's journey to go for updates.

This website was designed and developed by Corey Coburn.
